<div class="1">
   <h2 class="header1"> Introduction </h2>
   <hr class="line1">
   <p class="header2"> Our purpose: </p>
   <p> Our services enable users to purchase electronic accessories, such as mouse and laptop sleeves online and to have an overall great experience doing so. </p>
   <br>
   <p class="header2"> Legal Agreement: </p>
   <p> The terms constitute a bindin gand enforceable legal contract between Toilet Ltd. and you in relation to the use of any Toilet Services - so please read them carefully.  </p>
   <p> You may visit and/or use the Toilet Services only if you agree to the terms - and by using and/or registering to any of the Toilet Services, you signify and affirm your informed consent to these Terms of Use and any other terms applicable to your use of and other Soberful Services. If you do not read, fully understand and agree to the Toilet Terms, you must immediately leave the Toilet Website and avoid or discontinue all use of the Toilet
       Services. </p>
   <p> By using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read our Privacy Policy. </p>
   <br>
   <p class="header2"> User Account: </p>
   <p> In order to access and use certain sections and features of the Toilet Services, you must first register and create an account with Toilet (“User Account”) </p>
   <p> If anyone other than yourself accesses your User Account and/or any of your User Platforms’ settings, they may perform any actions available to you (unless as specifically stated otherwise on the Wix Services), make changes to your User Platform(s) and User Account, and accept any legal terms available therein, make various representations and warranties and more – and all such activities will be deemed to have occurred on your behalf and in your name. </p>
   <p> Therefore, we strongly encourage you to keep the log-in credentials of your User Account confidential, and allow such access only to people you trust - as you will be solely and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your User Account and/or User Platforms (including for any representations, warranties and undertakings made therein), whether or not specifically authorized by you, and for any damages, expenses or losses that may result from such activities. </p>
   <p> You must provide accurate and complete information when registering your User Account and using the Toilet Services, to which you are the sole and exclusive rights holder. We strongly encourage you to provide your own (or your company’s) contact and billing details, including your valid e-mail address, as we may use it to identify and determine the actual and true owner of the User Account and/or User Content (as defined below) submitted to us. </p>
   <p> In case of a dispute on User Account ownership, we reserve the right to determine ownership to a User Account based on our reasonable judgment, whether or not an independent investigation has been conducted by us. However, if we cannot make such determination (as we may deem in our sole discretion), we reserve the right to avoid doing so and/or suspend a User Account until the parties disputing such ownership, reach a resolution, without liability to you or to any other party. We may request documentation (e.g. government-issued ID, a business license) that may assist us in determining ownership. Among others, we may consider the principles set forth below. </p>
   <br>
   <p> 1. We will consider the owner of a User Account, User Platform and/or User Content created and/or uploaded to the relevant Toilet Service, as the person or entity who has access to the e-mail address then listed in Soberful’s records for such User Account under which such User Platform or User Content was created. </p>
   <p> 2. If any Paid Services (as defined in Section 5 below) were purchased via a User Account, We will consider the owner of such User Account and/or the relevant User Platform and/or User Content created thereunder, may be considered to be the person or entity whose billing details were used to purchase such Paid Services (“Billing Information”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, when applicable if a User Platform was connected to an external domain name (either imported or purchased as part of certain Paid Services, as defined below), and such domain’s registration information is publicly available via Toilet’s database, Toilet will consider the owner of such User Platform as the person or entity registered as the registrant of such domain thereunder. In the event that an individual and an organization are both registered as the registrant or the registrant organization of such domain, Soberful will consider the organization as the actual owner of the domain, and therefore as the owner of the User Platform connected to such domain. In event the Billing Information indicates one person as the owner of the User Platform and the domain registration indicates a different owner, Toilet shall consider the person registered as the owner of the domain connected to the Toilet Account as the owner of the User Platform. </p>
